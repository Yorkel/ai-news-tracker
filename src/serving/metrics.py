"""
metrics.py
Prometheus metric definitions for the classifier service.

These metrics are exposed at /metrics by prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator.
Standard HTTP metrics (request count, latency, in-progress) are added by the
instrumentator itself; this module defines the ML-specific custom metrics.

Metric design ties to the curator workflow:
  - top1_confidence captures how sure the model is about its #1 pick
  - confidence_gap (top1 − top2) captures the "needs human review" signal
    that drives the top-2 curator workflow
  - prediction_class_total catches class-distribution drift over time
  - input_text_length catches upstream pipeline failures (empty text_clean)
  - low_confidence_predictions_total is an explicit threshold-crossing counter
  - model_info is an info-style gauge labelled with the active run_id so
    Grafana queries can correlate metric values with the model version
