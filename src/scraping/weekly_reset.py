weekly_reset.py — archive + reset the curator's working week.

Run by .github/workflows/weekly_reset.yml every Monday morning (and triggerable
manually). Snapshots the current week's curator_decisions into
curator_decisions_archive, then records a new week boundary in curator_resets so
last week's kept/categorised articles drop out of the Categorise + Draft pages
and the new week starts fresh.

NON-DESTRUCTIVE: curator_decisions is left intact, so kept/rejected articles
keep their status (they don't reappear in Review) and pending articles are
untouched. The boundary only hides last week's work from Categorise + Draft.

This mirrors dashboard.data.archive_and_reset_week but is standalone (no
Streamlit) so it can run headless in CI.
