"""
summarise.py
Generate 1-2 sentence editorial summaries of accepted tracker articles
using the configured provider order. Called by the
dashboard when the curator clicks "Generate Summary" on an accepted article
(or in batch when assembling the draft).

Used by the scrape/sweep enrichment jobs and by the dashboard's manual
summary buttons. The functions are side-effect-free; callers decide whether to
write the returned summary to `articles` or `curator_decisions`.

Behaviour:
  - Reads 5 random anchor examples from the cleaned newsletter archive to
    anchor the in-house editorial voice, with a bundled fallback for CI/deploys.
  - Uses Claude Haiku 4.5 with prompt caching when Claude is selected: the
    system prompt + few-shot examples are cached, so each subsequent article
    costs ~$0.0003 instead of ~$0.0008.
  - Uses OpenAI as primary when ENRICH_PROVIDER=openai, with Claude as a
    best-effort fallback when configured.
  - If both providers are unavailable, returns a deterministic extractive
    fallback from the supplied article text, or "Summary unavailable".
  - Returns the generated summary as a plain string.
  - Has --dry-run mode that prints estimated cost without calling the API.

Cost reference (Haiku 4.5):
  Input $0.80 / output $4.00 per million tokens
  With caching: cached input is 90% off after the first call
  → ~$0.0003-$0.0008 per article = ~$0.04 per typical 50-item newsletter

Env:
  ENRICH_PROVIDER — choose openai or claude provider order
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY — Claude provider or fallback
  OPENAI_API_KEY — OpenAI provider or fallback
  OPENAI_SUMMARY_MODEL — optional override for the OpenAI model

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are writing 1-2 sentence summaries of articles for a
domain-specific news tracker digest. The audience is busy curators who need a
factual, source-faithful account of what each article says.

The editorial principle is strict: summarise the article using its own language.
Do NOT add framing, opinion, interpretation, policy context, or anything not
stated in the article itself.

Concrete rules:
- 1-2 sentences. Concise. Use the article's own phrasing wherever possible.
- Paraphrase or near-quote; do not interpret.
- Do NOT add words like "could", "may", or "is expected to" unless the article uses them.
- Do NOT add editorial verbs like "argues", "warns", "calls for", or "highlights" unless they appear in the article.
- Lead with what the article literally states the news, finding, or announcement is.
- Use the spelling and terminology of the source publication.
- No headlines, no titles, no markdown, no quotation marks. Plain summary text only.

CRITICAL behavioural rules:
- NEVER write meta-text like "I'd be happy to help", "the article content appears to be incomplete", "could you share more", or "I cannot provide".
- If the body text is missing or too sparse to faithfully summarise, output EXACTLY this string and nothing else: Summary unavailable
- Do NOT hallucinate. Do NOT invent facts, names, findings, or context that are not in the supplied text.
- Output ONLY the summary text or "Summary unavailable". No preamble.

SECOND PARAGRAPH — "Why this matters":
After the summary, add a blank line and then one short paragraph beginning
exactly "Why this matters: ".

This paragraph is the ONE place interpretation is allowed, and it is written
for a specific reader: an AI engineer working on evaluation, who writes a
weekly roundup of AI governance, safety, security, policy and geopolitics read
through an evaluation lens. Her subject is how AI is measured, checked and
claimed about — what an evaluation actually establishes, what institutions then
do on the strength of it, and who can see or challenge the number.

So in that paragraph, name the claim about an AI system that is at stake and
the question worth asking about it: whether the claim holds, what it licenses,
or who gets to check it. A chip export control is an evaluation story because
the threshold is set on a measured quantity. A safety framework is one because
it commits a lab to act on a test result. A regulation is one because someone
has to verify compliance.

Rules for the second paragraph:
- 1-2 sentences. No hedging padding.
- It may ASK a question or name what is unverified. It must NOT assert facts
  that are absent from the article.
- If the article carries no claim about an AI system worth interrogating, write
  exactly: Why this matters: Background rather than an evaluation story.
- Never flatter the reader or address her by name.

You will be given example summaries to anchor on, then asked to summarise a new
article. Those examples show the style of the FIRST paragraph only — match them
for the summary, then add the "Why this matters" paragraph as instructed."""
